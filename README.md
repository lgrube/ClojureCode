# ClojureCode
My repository as i learn clojure
I started this repository on july 29 and hoping to have a good understanding of clojure by august 17.
I will be using http://www.braveclojure.com/ for my reading and The joy of clojure.
Most of my code so far has been learning the basics in lein repl.
Learned there is no way to change a value after its already been stored just have to recreate the array or list or whatever your working with.
